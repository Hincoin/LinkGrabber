What is LinkGrabber?

LinkGrabber facilitates the process of downloading files from a website.
Some websites don't offer a "download all" or "download archive" option to
easily download all PDFs, videos, or any other type of extension. This tool
searches a given website for all links to user-specified extensions such as
(pdf,m4v,docx) and downloads them to a given directory.



How to use LinkGrabber?

Link grabber is a simple command-line (soon-to-be GUI) tool that requires
no command line arguments! Simply run the program and enter the corresponding
information it requires, such as the webpage to crawl, the directory to store
the downloaded files, and the extensions to search for.
